# 🌎 U.S. States-Quiz 🇺🇸

Welcome to the **U.S. States-Quiz**! This simple game allows you to guess all 50 U.S. states. As you guess each state, its name is displayed on the map in the correct location. The positions of the states are pre-defined using data from a `.csv` file.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Run** the `main.py` script.
2. A map of the U.S. will appear, along with a text field where you can type the name of a state.
3. **Type** the name of a state, and if it's correct, its name will be displayed in the correct location on the map.


## 🚀 Features

- **Guess all 50 U.S. states** and their locations on the map.
- **Correct guesses** will display the state's name at the correct position on the map.
- The game's position data comes from a **pre-defined `.csv` file** containing the state names and their coordinates on the map.
