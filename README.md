# U.S. States-Quiz
It's a quiz where the user can attempt to identify U.S. states, and if their guess is correct, the state's name will be displayed on a map. If the user enters "exit," they will receive a .csv file containing all the states they couldn't identify. This project was implemented in Python, utilizing the Turtle and Pandas libraries.
